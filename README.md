# VerseTimeJSON
This is my attempt at making VerseTime available as JSON. A link will be posted here if I ever succeed...

For now enjoy the [quadruple 'verse clock](https://darthmoebius.github.io/VerseTimeJSON/#Lorville/Orison/New_Babbage/Area18) for when you're traveling/trading/wanting to check times at multiple locations.
